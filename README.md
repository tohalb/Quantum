Quantum Programming Code

For the moment, this just has code from my MSc i.e. an implementation of Grover's algorithm and the Quantum Fourier Transform in Qiskit.

The Qiskit code assumes that an IBM ID is available in a separate file (obviously not supplied, as it would contain my identifying code). If you wish to run the code on an IBM Quantum Experience server, you will need to supply the file containing your access ID. An ID is not needed to run  it on the simulator.
